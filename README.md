# Ethereum Blockchain Voting System

## Introduction
Welcome to the Ethereum Blockchain Voting System repository! This project aims to create a decentralized, transparent, and secure voting system using the power of blockchain technology. By leveraging Ethereum and Brownie, our system ensures fair elections for companies, communities, or even countries. This repository contains the necessary code and instructions to set up and deploy your own blockchain-based voting system.

## Stack
- **Python**
  - Brownie
- **Solidity** (Version >=0.8.10 <0.9.0)
- **Metamask**
- **Infura**

## Features
- **Decentralization:** Eliminates the need for a central authority, making the voting process more transparent and secure.
- **Security:** Utilizes blockchain technology to ensure that votes are tamper-proof and verifiable.
